# JSON-to-SQL-Python
#### A simple command line tool to insert a JSON file into a SQL database

The app parses the directory, prompts the user to select a found JSON file.

The app then asks the user to select a prexisting table, or to create a new one to INSERT into.

The app then asks the user to map the 'keys' in the JSON objects to columns in the selected SQL table.
